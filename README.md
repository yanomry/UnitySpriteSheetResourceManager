# UnitySpriteSheetResourceManager
This singleton script will hold all your sprites from your sprite sheets that you need to load from the resources folder for whatever reason. It loads them all and adds them to a dictionary for quick lookup and prevents having to load the resources from every script you can simply call one of the prebuilt functions, or expand it for yourself!
